global level and donors are faced with critical trade-offs between Global Public Goods
(GPGs) – such as tackling climate change and pandemics – and investing directly in
countries themselves.
Attention has recently turned to other ways of raising financing; notably reforms of the
way multilateral development banks (MDBs) operate that could significantly scale up their
lending. While MDBs reform – in particular, capital adequacy reform – has the potential to
unlock hundreds of billions of additional development finance, this additional financing will
nearly all be in the form of loans and is far more likely to benefit middle-income countries.
