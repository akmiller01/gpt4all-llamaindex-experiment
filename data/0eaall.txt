from 31% to 24% over the same period. Figure 7 shows what happens if these trends are
extrapolated to 2025. In absolute terms, bilateral aid stagnated, remaining at US$33
billion in both 2011 and 2021. This is despite international agreements to increase ODA
spending in LDCs: DAC countries have committed to spending 0.15–0.2% of their GNI on
aid to LDCs. 46 Between 2011 and 2021, DAC countries got further away from this goal,
with aid spent in LDCs falling from 0.10% to 0.09% of DAC GNI. 47 This figure includes
‘imputed multilateral spend’ – the share of core multilateral contributions that supports
disbursements in LDCs from multilateral organisations.
