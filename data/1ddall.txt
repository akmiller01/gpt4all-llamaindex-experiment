the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), increased from
around 24% in 2012–2013 to 36% in 2019–2020. 34 If these shares are assumed to be
similar to those in 2011 and 2021 respectively, then around US$8 billion of the increase
in disbursements from multilaterals would be climate related. This is only indicative given
data constraints. But it highlights that multilateral ODA disbursements have followed
broadly the same trend as bilateral ODA, and, if accurate, implies that disbursements
from DAC and multilaterals for long-term, development-specific priorities fell by around
US$14 billion between 2011 and 2021.
