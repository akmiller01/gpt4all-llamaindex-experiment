Around 32% of the increase in non-allocable aid is in the form of loans or equity. This
includes capital contributions to development finance institutions such as DEG and
Proparco.
Another 9% is from capital contributions to British International Investment and
NORFUND (the UK and Norway have counted such contributions as grants in the
Creditor Reporting System data).
