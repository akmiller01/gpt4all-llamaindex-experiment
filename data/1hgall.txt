transfer ODA by G7
countries
Non-transfer aid is official development assistance (ODA) that does not reach partner
countries. Examples are ODA spent on administration costs and on in-donor refugee
costs. While most countries recorded significantly increased in-donor refugee costs in the
mid-2010s for example, there are also major differences in the non-transfer categories on
which donors spend ODA. This annex examines recent trends in G7 countries, which
together accounted for 78% of ODA in 2021.
