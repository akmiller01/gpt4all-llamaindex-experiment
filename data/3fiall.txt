disproportionately benefit the poor. While multilateral organisations have increased their
focus on LDCs to counteract this trend, the higher share of loans in their ODA
disbursements has meant that grant financing for LDCs has still declined (when
humanitarian and Covid aid are excluded).
The fact that bilateral ODA is moving in the wrong direction – away from the countries
with greatest poverty, away from pro-poor sectors and away from grants where they are
needed most – suggests that we need a re-think. When the reactive elements of ODA are
removed, how do donors decide to allocate what is left, and how could this be improved?
