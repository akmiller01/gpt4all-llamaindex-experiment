It has been replaced as the largest non-transfer category by in-donor refugee costs, as
conflict in the Middle East has led to large numbers of people seeking asylum in DAC
countries. Germany was at the heart of this change. It increased expenditure on in-donor
refugee costs 45-fold between 2014 and 2016, from US$163 million to US$7.3 billion. In
2016, this was 25% of Germanyâ€™s total ODA (although Germany also increased transfer
aid by 32% over the same period). Germany was the country spending the most on in-
donor refugee costs from 2015 until 2021 when the US tripled its spending on in-donor
refugee costs. The UK also dramatically increased its spending on in-donor refugee costs
