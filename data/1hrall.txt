transfer was much higher at the end of the decade than at the beginning: between 2011
and 2021 the share increased from 13% to 17%. Most of this increase happened in 2021,
when the US tripled its expenditure on in-donor refugee costs (from US$1.5 billion to
US$4.6 billion), which meant that it spent the largest share of ODA on in-donor refugee
costs among the G7 in that year. The US saw the smallest increase in transfer ODA over
this period (other than the UK which recorded a decline). However, as with non-transfer
ODA, this increase all came in 2021; transfer ODA in 2020 was slightly lower than in
2011. Therefore, the increases in transfer and non-transfer ODA coincided.
