Notes: LDC = least developed country; ODA = official development assistance; DAC = Development Assistance
Committee (OECD). Continuation of trend scenarios (average annual change) for ODA to LDCs % total over
both last three years and last ten years lead to 23% in 2025 DAC bilateral ODA to LDCs % of total. This was
based on following the trajectory of ODA to LDCs as a percentage of total bilateral ODA (including non-country
allocable). Applying three-year and ten-year average annual growth both resulted in the 23% value. Considering
ODA to LDCs as a share of country-allocable ODA from DAC donors, the trend is relatively stable, with ODA to
LDCs remaining at around 40% over the last decade. The range is from 37% to 45% but there is no downward
trend, and the 2010 value of 41% is close to the 2021 value of 40%.
