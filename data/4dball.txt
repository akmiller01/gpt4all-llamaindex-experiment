around 60%), this was largely in response to the above factors. When Covid,
humanitarian assistance and climate-marked ODA are removed, the increase is reduced
to US$10 billion (from US$39.0 billion to US$48.7 billion). While this is insufficient to fill
the gap left by the reduction in bilateral disbursements, it suggests that more of the
increase in multilateral disbursements was towards ‘traditional’ development priorities.
However, this understates the increase in disbursements with a climate focus, given that
most multilaterals do not use the Rio marker to indicate such projects. When this is
accounted for, the trend looks similar to the bilateral trend.
