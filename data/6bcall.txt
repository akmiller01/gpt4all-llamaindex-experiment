Estimates of total finance needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
generally amount to trillions of dollars. One of the most recent and comprehensive
estimates (by Bhattacharya and colleagues at the London School of Economics) 10 builds
on a range of previous studies and finds that, by 2025, financing worth US$3.7 trillion will
be needed in emerging markets and developing economies other than China, rising to
US$5.9 trillion in 2030. These estimates are highly uncertain, 11 and a lack of financing is
not necessarily the only constraint. 12 Nevertheless, these figures are illustrative and
demonstrate the order of magnitude of new development finance needed.
