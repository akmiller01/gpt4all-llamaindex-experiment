investments must identity: (a) who specifically they are benefiting, and (b) whether
they are targeting the places where people are living in poverty, such as least
developed countries (LDCs).
What is the evidence on the probability of impact? Assessing the probability that
resources are going to deliver an impact for poverty reduction needs to take into
account the comparative advantage of ODA in reaching people living in poverty. ODA
investments need to consider: (a) what alternatives exist that could deliver the same
return on investment, and (b) why the proposed investment is a better choice.
