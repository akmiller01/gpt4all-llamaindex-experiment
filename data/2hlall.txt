Germany also spends considerably more than most countries on imputed student costs
(totalling 5% of ODA between 2011 and 2021, more than any other G7 country but
France). Despite the growth in Germanyâ€™s non-transfer ODA, it also sharply increased its
transfer ODA, which more than doubled over the last decade (from US$12.9 billion to
US$28.1 billion, or from 0.37% to 0.69% of GNI). Even between 2014 and 2016, when its
non-transfer ODA tripled, Germany simultaneously increased its expenditure on transfer
ODA.
