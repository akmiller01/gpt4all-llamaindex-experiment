The anticipated ODA spend would be equal to around 0.43% of gross national income
(GNI) of countries in the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in 2025, according to
forecasts of the International Monetary Fund. This a greater share than has been spent

breakdown would imply that DAC countries would need an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.56%,
higher than has ever been achieved (see Figure 1 below). This breakdown is only
illustrative, but highlights that official finance, including ODA, will continue to play a major
