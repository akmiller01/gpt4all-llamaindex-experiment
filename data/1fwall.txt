When will the benefits be felt? The timeframe for returns on aid investments is
critical for individuals whose life choices are limited. To measure the benefits of one
intervention against another, ODA investments should consider the transformational
benefits for people living in poverty in both the short and long term. For instance, the
benefits of building a road to people living in greatest poverty may take years to have
an impact, whereas the effect of a cash transfer programme can be immediate.
Another important consideration is balancing in-country investments with GPGs, as
the latter may require longer timeframes.
