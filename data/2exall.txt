development. At the same time, even highly concessional lending can add to debt
burdens in the countries of greatest poverty and may be less appropriate than grant
financing, especially given that the majority of LDCs are at risk of debt distress as noted
above. Countries that were in debt distress in 2023 recorded a decline in their share of
grant financing in development aid from DAC countries and multilaterals from 86% to
76% between 2011 and 2021. For countries that were at high risk of debt distress, the
decline was from 83% to 66%.
How much aid actually reaches the countries with the greatest poverty?
