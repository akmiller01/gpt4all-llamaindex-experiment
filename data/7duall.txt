ODA – and grant financing in particular – has a comparative advantage in those places
where other sources of finance are hard to raise. In practice, this means poorer countries
and especially least developed countries (LDCs) with the large majority now experiencing
problems with loan financing due to a moderate risk of debt distress or worse. 42 In
addition, some sectors that are particularly important for poverty reduction (health,
education and other social services for example) are sectors in which generating a
financial return is comparatively difficult. ODA is thus particularly important in these
sectors.
