less appropriate for our purposes. Because of its focus on programmable aid, CPA
excludes humanitarian assistance, which is an important (and growing) part of
transfer aid. In addition, CPA does not include aid that cannot be allocated by
country. While such aid is often non-transfer, it also includes core funding for
NGOs, and contributions to pooled funds that are ultimately spent in partner
countries and therefore included in transfer aid. Both concepts have their uses, but
for the purposes of tracking what countries actually receive, our focus in this report
is on transfer ODA.
