mobilisation and private sector investment. The Bhattacharya report estimates that, in
2025, domestic resources would need to account for just under two-thirds of the total
finance, and that private sector finance would need to account for around one-fifth. This
would leave around 15% to be covered by additional external public finance, including
non-concessional flows from multilateral development banks (MDBs). While this is a
comparatively small share of the total, it would still amount to around US$557 billion
(nearly US$200 billion more than was spent in 2021). Of this amount, around half
(US$272 billion) would come from official development assistance (ODA).
