While climate finance is necessary for countries to make sustainable investments, the
data suggests that it is currently coming at the expense of other necessary investments.
This is especially problematic when ODA is being used to fund investments that could
have attracted other types of finance. For example, it is estimated that US$300 billion in
investments is required to generate sufficient clean energy in Middle Eastern and African
countries (most of which are ODA-eligible) 33 every year. ODA cannot fund these needs
while also tackling poverty. Given that many such projects are likely to generate financial
returns, there could be other types of finance better suited to addressing this challenge.
