the pressure on public budgets due to the Covid-19 pandemic response, ODA-like flows
have the potential to be flexible and adaptable to the pressing and short-term needs of
governments â€“ particularly in tackling urgent investment in the sectors that
disproportionally benefit people living in poverty.
Many of these sectors remain central to an equitable pandemic-recovery agenda that
strengthens the resilience of the people living in greatest poverty. Differential needs
between regions, countries and at subnational levels necessitate flexibility to respond to
context. Therefore, a rigid prescription of an exclusive set of sectors is unhelpful.
