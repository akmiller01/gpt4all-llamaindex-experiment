introduced in 1988, and only US$4 million in 2011–2021). However, Japan is a country
that primarily provides ODA in the form of loans, and it occasionally records ODA on relief
of such loans, although this counts only towards gross ODA. Debt relief therefore
accounted for 34% of Japan’s non-transfer ODA between 2011 and 2021, or 2.5% of total
ODA. The largest category of non-transfer ODA for Japan is administrative costs (3.8% of
ODA between 2011 and 2021), but this is nevertheless below the average for both the
DAC and G7.
