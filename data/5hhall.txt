second-largest category was administrative costs: Canada consistently spent the second-
highest share of ODA on this category, behind the US. Over the last decade, it accounted
for 5% of total ODA. Canada had the smallest variation in share spent on non-transfer
ODA over the last decade, varying between 13% and 18% but showing no consistent
trend. By contrast, Canada’s transfer ODA consistently fell as a share of gross national
income (GNI) in the first years of the last decade (until 2014) but then rose back to
around its 2011 level (from 0.27% of GNI in 2011 to 0.28% in 2021).
