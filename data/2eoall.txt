The decline in bilateral aid to LDCs (both relative and in absolute terms) has been offset

absolute increase in ODA disbursements to LDCs of US$5 billion between 2011 and
2021 (when humanitarian, Covid and non-transfer aid are removed).
Although the change in multilateral ODA disbursements counteracted the bilateral shift
