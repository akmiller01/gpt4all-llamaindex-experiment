since 1968. The same recent study by Bhattacharya and colleagues 13 anticipates that
financing needs will grow faster than DAC-country GNI, meaning that, by 2030, the same
breakdown would imply that DAC countries would need an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.56%,
higher than has ever been achieved (see Figure 1 below). This breakdown is only
illustrative, but highlights that official finance, including ODA, will continue to play a major
role in meeting the SDGs. In addition, in this breakdown Bhattacharya and colleagues
anticipate that private finance could double by 2025 (Figure 2). If this large increase does
not materialise, the role for official finance will be even larger.
