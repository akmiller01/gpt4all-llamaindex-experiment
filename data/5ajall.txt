The comparative role of ODA in meeting growing global needs
ODA is a limited resource that needs to be focused and used wisely where it is most
needed to maximise its comparative advantage. If shared equally between every person
worldwide experiencing extreme poverty, the US$189 billion in gross ODA provided in
2021 equates to US$0.75 per person per day. Balancing growing, competing demands –
as well as other motivations and uses of ODA – while maintaining a focus on eradicating
poverty or promoting economic growth, is the fundamental challenge facing policymakers.
