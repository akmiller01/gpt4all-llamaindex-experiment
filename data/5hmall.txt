location on the Mediterranean, Italy was one of the main arrival points for refugees
attempting to reach Europe. France, Germany and the US are the only countries to have
received more asylum applications since 2014, but given that they have much larger ODA
programmes, Italyâ€™s expenditure led to a greater share of in-donor refugee costs in ODA.
However, Italy consistently increased its expenditure on transfer ODA throughout the
decade, which rose from US$2.9 billion to US$5 billion between 2011 and 2021, or from
0.15% to 0.25% of GNI.
