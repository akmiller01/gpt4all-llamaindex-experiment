This chapter calls for poverty reduction to be a key driver in the allocation of official
development assistance (ODA). We see from analysis and evidence presented in
previous chapters that this is currently not the case. Pandemic recovery efforts, rising
food insecurity, debt, inflation and the Ukraine crisis are all key challenges for the world
and international public investment plays a key role in all of them. While spending money
on combating Covid or helping Ukrainian refugees is undoubtedly good, ODA is charged
with addressing ever more issues, such as climate mitigation and rising in-donor refuge
costs. Unless ODA increases accordingly, traditional development priorities will lose out.
