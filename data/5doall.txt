increase. The amount spent on in-donor refugee costs increased nearly six-fold in
constant prices. While the number of asylum applications is not a perfect measure of
need, using this as a proxy suggests that per capita in-donor refugee costs have doubled
over this period: from around US$5,500 spent on in-donor refugee costs per asylum
application received by the DAC in 2006, to US$11,100 in 2021. This is partly explained
by countries choosing to count more ODA in this category when the issue became more
prominent. For example, before 2009 the UK did not count any in-donor refugee costs
