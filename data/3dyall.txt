loans. Given that most LDCs are currently at ‘moderate’ or higher risk of debt distress, 45
there are question marks over the extent to which they can significantly scale up even
concessional borrowing.
While the reform efforts may not directly benefit LDCs, they nevertheless present an
opportunity. ODA’s comparative advantage in LDCs is likely to increase. LDCs are the
group most in need of grant (and highly concessional) financing and have the fewest
alternative financing options. The greater volume of finance unlocked by reform efforts
could open space to pivot ODA towards LDCs.
