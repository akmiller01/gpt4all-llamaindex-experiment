Notes: LDC = least developed country; LMIC = lower middle-income country; UMIC = upper middle-income
country; ODA = official development assistance; CRS = Creditor Reporting System (OECD DAC). LDCs include
some countries that are middle-income according to World Bank income classifications, and therefore there is
some overlap between bars. 2018 was the latest year with full data.
Therefore, unless the financing mix changes, ODA to LDCs would need to double to meet
