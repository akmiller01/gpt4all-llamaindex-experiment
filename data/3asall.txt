LDCs, will only increase. Currently, governments are discussing important reform efforts
of the multilateral development bank (MDB) system that will allow greater leverage of
MDB balance sheets to unlock hundreds of billions of additional development finance.
However, this additional finance is likely to be directed towards middle-income countries
(currently, only 16% of disbursements from MDBs are to LDCs) and will be largely in the
form of loans. Given that the majority of LDCs are currently at ‘moderate’ or higher risk of
debt distress, 9 there are question marks over the extent to which they can significantly
scale up even concessional borrowing.
