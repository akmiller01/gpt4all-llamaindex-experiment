such as global health, climate change and security means that GPGs are competing with
traditional development priorities: there are calls for investment in both global initiatives
and in countries other than those with the lowest incomes, as wealthier countries are
considered better able to drive regional and global progress in areas such as political and
environmental security. The result is reduced ODA to countries experiencing the greatest
poverty. In other words, the additional needs generated by these external events mean
there is less funding left to spend on traditional priorities in the countries needing it the
most.
