(including indirectly via core multilateral ODA) has averaged 86% of the total. In
2021, total ODA was US$189 billion in gross disbursement terms, but a maximum
of US$163 billion reached low- and middle-income countries (including aid directed
through multilaterals).
However, the composition of such non-transfer aid has changed significantly over
time. Historically, by far the largest component of non-transfer aid has been debt
relief, accounting for 8% of total ODA on average during the 1990s and 2000s,
Debt relief reached its peak in 2005 when it accounted for 21.7% of total ODA.
