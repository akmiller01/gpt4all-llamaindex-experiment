Therefore, as with spending in response to pandemics and humanitarian situations, these
types of spending are worthwhile, but fundamentally different from ODA that gets
transferred to recipient countries and can be used for longer-term development. To the
extent that they are counted under the same input targets as programmable aid, they
reduce the extent to which ODA is intentionally directed towards the goals of either
donors or recipients and increase the extent to which it is just a contingency fund,
reacting to events.
How much aid actually reaches the countries with the greatest poverty?
