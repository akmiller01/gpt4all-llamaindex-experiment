France
France spent 15% of total ODA on non-transfer categories between 2011 and 2021,
which was roughly equal to the average among G7 countries (but higher than the
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) average of 14%). While a significant share of
this was accounted for by in-donor refugee costs (5% of ODA), unlike most DAC
countries, Franceâ€™s largest non-transfer category over this period was imputed student
costs (5.6%). Among the G7 countries, France spent the most on this category between
2011 and 2021, although the share of ODA spent on this category has declined steadily
