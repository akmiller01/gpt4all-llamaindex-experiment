support national and international needs and priorities is beginning to involve – through
Global Public Investment (GPI), for example – but in the interim ODA remains critical to
the reduction of poverty.
ODA plays a critical role, particularly in the countries with greatest poverty like least-
developed countries (LDCs) where domestic resources are scarce and access to
international markets is difficult. However, its scale is still small. As donors face choices of
where to strategically invest their money, it is important that they are aware of the
different trade-offs and the different routes towards poverty reduction.
