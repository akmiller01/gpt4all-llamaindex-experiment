Bilateral gross ODA from DAC countries grew to a new peak of US$136 billion in 2021,
an increase of 32% over the last decade. However, this has been driven by particular
circumstances that have generated new, additional needs, and the increase in ODA has
not been sufficient to meet these needs while maintaining expenditure on existing
priorities. When we exclude spending on Covid-related activities, in-donor refugee costs,
humanitarian assistance and climate-marked ODA, the remaining bilateral ODA from
DAC countries has declined by 7% since 2019 (before the Covid-19 pandemic) and by
19% since 2011 (see Figure 5 below).
