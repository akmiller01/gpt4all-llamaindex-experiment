other resources by focusing on places where poverty is greatest. Looking at what we call
‘non-transfer aid’ in Chapter 2, we then unpack the ODA numbers to explore what is left

has targeted poverty. We end this report by proposing a set of principles for ODA
allocation that prioritise the people living in greatest poverty (Chapter 4).
