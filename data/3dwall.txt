finance (such as foreign direct investment or remittances) and are generally far less able
to mobilise domestic resources. In 2019, domestic resources were only US$150 per
person on average in LDCs – just a third of the level in LMICs – making it harder for them
to finance key sectors such as health and education. Consequently, poverty is
increasingly concentrated in this group of countries. These characteristics are reflected in
the commitment of Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries to spend at least
0.15% of gross national income (GNI) on aid to LDCs, 44 a target which has rarely been
met.
