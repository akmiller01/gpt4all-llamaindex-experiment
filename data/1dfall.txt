student costs, in-donor scholarships and promotion of development awareness. The
inclusion of some of these costs in ODA is controversial. For example, civil society
organisations have long criticised the inclusion of in-donor refugee costs. 35 While these
may represent useful expenditure (for example, administrative costs may include
expenditure on project evaluation or skilled staff), this does not necessarily mean they
should count as ODA, and they nevertheless do not increase resources available for low-
or middle-income countries.
