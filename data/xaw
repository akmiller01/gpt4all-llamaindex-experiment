estimates 5 suggest that, by 2025, financing worth US$3.7 trillion will be needed in

2030. Much of this will be met by increases in domestic resource mobilisation and private
finance, although ODA has comparative advantage among international sources of
finance when it comes to reaching the people living in greatest poverty.
