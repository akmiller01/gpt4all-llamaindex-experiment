We need a coherent allocation framework that prioritises the
people living in greatest poverty
Existing models do not lay out a clear allocation framework that prioritises the people
living in greatest poverty. The absence of a clear purpose for ODA means that it risks
becoming increasingly subject to the domestic whims of narrowly defined and incoherent
short-term donor priorities. With growing demands for ODA, and inconsistencies in how
aid is currently allocated, there is a clear need for robust logic that defines how ODA is
allocated, for whom and with what outcomes.
