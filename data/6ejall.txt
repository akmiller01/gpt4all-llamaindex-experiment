Notes: ODA = official development assistance; LMIC = lower middle-income country; LDC = least developed
country; UMIC = upper middle-income country. Covid ODA is identified using purpose code 12264 and the
‘keyword’ variable. For convenience, the LDC category includes ‘other LICs’, and the UMICs category includes
a small amount of aid to ‘More advanced countries and territories (MADCCTs)’. This is a very small share of the
total in each case. ODA unallocated by income is that for which a specific recipient country cannot be identified,
for example, because it has been given to a special purpose fund which operates in numerous countries.
