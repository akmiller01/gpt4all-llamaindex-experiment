to be in the form of grant financing: between 2011 and 2021, 83% of bilateral aid was in
the form of grants, whereas the corresponding figure for multilaterals was 55%. The
increase in the relative importance of multilaterals for ODA disbursements to LDCs has
decreased the average concessionality of these disbursements. The share of grants in
total ODA disbursements to LDCs fell from 84% to 64% between 2011 and 2021. Grant
financing for LDCs from DAC countries and multilaterals fell over this period, from US$30
billion to US$26 billion (see Figure 9 below).
How much aid actually reaches the countries with the greatest poverty?
