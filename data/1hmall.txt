Italy
Among the G7, Italy has spent the largest share of ODA on non-transfer categories over
the last decade, at 23%. Most of this was from in-donor refugee costs, which peaked at
32% of ODA in 2016, and accounted for 18% of ODA between 2011 and 2021. Given its
location on the Mediterranean, Italy was one of the main arrival points for refugees
attempting to reach Europe. France, Germany and the US are the only countries to have
received more asylum applications since 2014, but given that they have much larger ODA
programmes, Italyâ€™s expenditure led to a greater share of in-donor refugee costs in ODA.
