international community needs to be more considerate about how ODA is spent to
address immediate crises and to drive sustained pathways out of poverty. We propose a
focus on ODA allocations that prioritise the people living in greatest poverty. Investments
must identify who will benefit, where and over what timeframe, as well as demonstrating
that they disproportionally benefit those living in poverty. This report focuses on the
fundamental role of ODA, reminding us that these considerations are more important than
ever before at a time when ODA is being appropriated by multiple and competing
interests.
