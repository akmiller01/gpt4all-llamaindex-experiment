using purpose code 12264 and the ‘keyword’ variable. For convenience, the LDC category includes ‘other LICs’.
This is a very small share of the total.
This shift away from grants is not solely a result of a higher share of ODA disbursements
originating from multilaterals. The share of grants in total bilateral ODA to LDCs fell from
97% to 87% between 2011 and 2021, and from 96% to 82% when non-transfer, Covid
and humanitarian assistance are removed. However, multilaterals remain much less likely
to provide aid in the form of grants: in 2021, only 47% of multilateral aid to LDCs
(excluding Covid and humanitarian) was in the form of grants.
