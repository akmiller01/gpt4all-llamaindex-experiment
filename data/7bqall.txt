compared to only 6% for lower middle-income countries, and 1% for upper middle-income
countries. However, this still understates the importance of ODA for achieving the SDGs
in these countries, because neither tax revenue nor private finance will be spent entirely
on achieving the SDGs. For example, research by the International Monetary Fund found
that in Sub-Saharan Africa (home to the majority of LDCs) only a quarter of cross-border
private investment was spent in SDG-related sectors. 17 In addition, the World Bank
estimates that around 8% of total LDC government expenditure was on the military. 18
When adjusting for these figures, ODA accounts for 30% of SDG-related finance in LDCs
