which was roughly equal to the average among G7 countries (but higher than the
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) average of 14%). While a significant share of
this was accounted for by in-donor refugee costs (5% of ODA), unlike most DAC
countries, France’s largest non-transfer category over this period was imputed student
costs (5.6%). Among the G7 countries, France spent the most on this category between
2011 and 2021, although the share of ODA spent on this category has declined steadily
since 2013. Similarly, France spent a considerable amount of ODA on debt relief early in
the decade, averaging 9% between 2011 and 2013, but this declined to zero in 2021.
